## Creating a DAPP for the KeepKey Desktop

(tutorial is dependent on a BETA release of [keepkey-desktop](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-desktop/releases). I will update this tutorial when it is released. [how to join BETA](https://medium.com/@highlander_35968/how-to-be-beta-tester-for-keepkey-cf74919dde0))

In this tutorial, we will create an application that sends and receives the cryptocurrency DASH. This exercise will demonstrate how quickly and easily multi-chain applications can be developed on KeepKey using the KeepKey Desktop Application.

Straight to the code: [https://github.com/BitHighlander/dash-dapp](https://github.com/BitHighlander/dash-dapp)

* Use Pioneer-SDK to query the blockchain for DASH UTXO info

* Create a basic Wallet with send and receive functionality

* publish this app with Vercel.io and take it to production

* Submit a production app to the KeepKey Dapp store via pioneer

## KeepKey Dapp Template

To use this tutorial we start from the [example template repo](https://github.com/BitHighlander/dapp-template)

    git clone https://github.com/BitHighlander/dapp-template dash-dapp

 1. Clone the project:

    git clone https://github.com/BitHighlander/dapp-template dash-dapp

3. Remove the template repo from upstream:

    git remote rm origin 

4. Push to our own github:

If you are using and IDE like webstorm or VScode, simply open the new dash-dapp directory in your IDE here.

Now push as a new project to github

Webstorm:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2772/1*uyXYh1Aamzhprq_3KDUEyw.png)

Push new Branch as master

Git commands:

    git remote add origin <our_repo_url> 
    git push origin master

## Lets start building

Now build

    yarn && yarn dev

Run this app, and connect your keepkey. Setup a wallet and if you havent already.

## KeepKey sdk

Now we need the application to load the users’ DASH balances on startup. To do this, we will import the KeepKey SDK. We will use the API call `getPubkeys` to generate an Xpub for DASH.

We use the SDK to get the publicKey for Dash

          let path =
            {
              symbol: 'DASH',
              address_n: [0x80000000 + 44, 0x80000000 + 5, 0x80000000 + 0],
              coin: 'Bitcoin',
              script_type: 'p2pkh',
              showDisplay: false
            }
    
          let responsePubkey = await sdk.system.info.getPublicKey(path)
          console.log("responsePubkey: ", responsePubkey)
          console.log("responsePubkey: ", responsePubkey.xpub)
>  Note that the path for DASH is 5. as found on [https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)

And Finally we get the xpub for dash returned.

## UI work, lets prep the application for balance and address

we are using useState to set values from inside our onStart function for elements in the UI.

      const [address, setAddress] = useState('')
      const [balance, setBalance] = useState('0.000')

## Next up, lets calculate the balance for DASH

Now we getting the fun stuff. we need to figure out how much DASH a user has a balance on. To do this we going to import the pioneer-sdk

    yarn add @pioneer-platform/pioneer-client

### first we import the Pioneer-sdk, and configure

          const configPioneer = {
            queryKey:'sdk:test-tutorial-medium',
            username:"dash-dapp",
            spec:"https://pioneers.dev/spec/swagger.json"
          }
          let pioneer = new Client(configPioneer.spec,configPioneer)
          pioneer = await pioneer.init()

We are setting the queryKey, username and spec
>  *Pioneer API docs can be found [here](https://pioneers.dev/docs)*

Next we use the api client to query unspent inputs for an xpub.
>  *An xpub is a public key used in a hierarchical deterministic wallet system, and more information can be found in this blog post: [*https://www.swanbitcoin.com/whats-in-an-xpub/](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/whats-in-an-xpub/)

          //get balance DASH
          let data = await pioneer.ListUnspent({network:'DASH',xpub:responsePubkey.xpub})
          data = data.data
          console.log("txData: ",data)

And finally we iterate over these inputs for calculate a balance

          let balance = 0
          for(let i = 0; i < data.length; i++){
            balance += parseInt(data[i].value)
          }
          console.log("balance: ",balance)
          let balanceNative = balance
          setBalance(balanceNative)

(NOTE) You can checkout “[checkpoint-](https://github.com/BitHighlander/dash-dapp/tree/checkpoint-1)2” to continue the tutorial from this point

## Now let’s see it all work!

Lets fire up our site

    yarn start

And open up KeepKey Desktop
[**KeepKey**
*KeepKey is the leading hardware wallet for securely storing digital assets. Our Dapp Store offers access to thousands…*keepkey.com](https://keepkey.com)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2404/1*DUKPXUncS6VvC3fc7CH14A.png)

And we see our balance!

Now lets generate a fresh address for the user to deposit DASH to.

          //get new address
          let newAddyIndex = await pioneer.GetChangeAddress({network:'DASH',xpub:responsePubkey.xpub})
          newAddyIndex = newAddyIndex.data.changeIndex
          newAddyIndex = newAddyIndex + 1
          console.log("newAddyIndex: ",newAddyIndex)

Pioneer will use the Xpub to scan the blockchain and detect any past transactions associated with the wallet. It will then create a list of all used and unused addresses associated with the wallet and determine the next unused address index.

BIP44 paths are hierarchical deterministic paths used to generate public and private keys for cryptocurrency wallets. These paths are constructed using a 4-level tree structure, consisting of the following levels: purpose (m), coin type (44'/0'/0'/0), account (0), and change (0). BIP44 paths are used to ensure that the same wallet can be used for multiple coins and accounts, while keeping funds secure and organized.

and send it back to KeepKey-desktop’s api for generating the address

          let addressInfo = {
            addressNList: [0x80000000 + 44, 0x80000000 + 5, 0x80000000 + 0, 0x80000000 + newAddyIndex],
            coin: 'Dash',
            scriptType: 'p2pkh',
            showDisplay: false
          }
    
          let address = await sdk.address.uTXOGetAddress({
            address_n: addressInfo.addressNList,
            script_type:addressInfo.scriptType,
            coin:addressInfo.coin
          })

The 0x80000000 is a hexadecimal notation that indicates the beginning of the hard coded path for the Dash network. This path is used to differentiate it from other networks when sending or receiving funds. The 5 indicates that this is a Dash network address. This is used to identify the currency being used and ensure that the funds are being sent to the correct network.

And now we have a fresh address for the user to deposit too!

Read more about why not re-using addresses is important here [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse)

and now we have an App that a user can send dash into!

(NOTE) You can checkout “[checkpoint-](https://github.com/BitHighlander/dash-dapp/tree/checkpoint-1)7” to continue the tutorial from this point

## Now let’s send DASH!

In order to send we are first going to add a send modal

[https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/modal](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/modal)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2972/1*bM5xeeJc7Re_Vlzvdj_bfQ.png)

[https://github.com/BitHighlander/dash-dapp/commit/2b09208d16816284e68a238713e3eca9dcc375b9](https://github.com/BitHighlander/dash-dapp/commit/2b09208d16816284e68a238713e3eca9dcc375b9)

Now lets add fields for

Amount: amount of dash we with to send

Address: the Dash Address we wish to send to

we add these values to our react state

      const [amount, setAmount] = useState('0.00000000')
      const [toAddress, setToAddress] = useState('')
    

And we add the following into our modal itself

                <div>
                  amount: <input type="text" name="amount" value={amount}/>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div>
                  address: <input type="text" name="address" value={toAddress} placeholder="XwNbd46qdmbVWLdXievBhBMW7JYy8WiE7n"/>
                </div>

And after we intake the values from the input fields we call a function onSend()

                <Button colorScheme='green' mr={3} onClick={onSend}>
                  Send
                </Button>

and we mock out this onSend with just a log for now

      let onSend = async function(){
        try{
          //
          console.log("Sending Dash!")
        }catch(e){
          console.error(e)
        }
      }

7. Ok Not lets actually send some DASH!

To send dash we need to build a transaction. This is generally the most complication part of working with crypto. its important to understand the dangers here. When working with a UXTO transaction we are calulating a fee. this fee is generally represented by

    sum(inputs) - sum(outputs) = fee

If you miscalculate a fee, for instance forgetting or dropping the change address output of a transaction this fee goes to the DASH miners and is essentially lost.

Our send modal will have 3 steps

* Generate transaction

* Sign transaction

* Broadcast Transaction

So first we need the inputs that were queried for the balance. so we are going to add a param to the react state that is our inputs.

      const [inputs, setInputs] = useState([])

and set them on startup

          let data = await pioneer.ListUnspent({network:'DASH',xpub:responsePubkey.xpub})
          data = data.data
          setInputs(data)

Now lets create our output object

          //balance check
          let amountOut = parseInt(amount * 100000000)
          if(amountOut >  balance) throw new Error("Insufficient funds!") 
          
          //prepare coinselect
          let utxos = []
          for(let i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++){
            let input = inputs[i]
            let utxo = {
              txId:input.txid,
              vout:input.vout,
              value:parseInt(input.value),
              nonWitnessUtxo: Buffer.from(input.hex, 'hex'),
              hex: input.hex,
              tx: input.tx,
              path:input.path
            }
            utxos.push(utxo)
          }
          if (utxos.length === 0) throw Error("101 YOUR BROKE! no UTXO's found! ")
    
          let outputs = [
            {
              address:toAddress,
              value: amountOut
            }
          ]

Here we are prepping the uxto format to match the params needed for coinselect. A npm package we using for UXTO selection
[**coinselect**
*An unspent transaction output (UTXO) selection module for bitcoin. WARNING: Value units are in satoshis, not Bitcoin…*www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/coinselect)

UTXO selection can be very dynamic. By using specific algorithms, we can minimize the size of the transaction and therefore the cost of transaction fees. In this example, we will be using Blackjack, the default algorithm provided by Coinselect.

However, before we do this, we need to collect fee data from the Pioneer API. We need to know the recommended fee amount to add to the transaction.

Now, we submit the inputs, outputs, and fee to Coinselect. This will generate the optimal selection of UTXOs for our transaction.

    const coinSelect = require('coinselect')
    
    
    ...
    
    let selectedResults = coinSelect(utxos, targets, feeRateInfo)
    console.log("result coinselect algo: ",selectedResults)
    
    

The result we get from coinselect is as follows

    {
        "inputs": [
            {
                "txId": "7bf822b0d24094b9eb95bc536fc83e2ea2250d76b3ee485efa173ba91a607eaf",

                            }
                        },
                        {

                        }

                },
                "path": "m/44'/5'/0'/0/0"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "address": "XwNbd46qdmbVWLdXievBhBMW7JYy8WiE7n",
                "value": 100000000
            },
            {
                "value": 38789140
            }
        ],
        "fee": 2260
    }

Now we need to format this transaction for the keepkey to sign.

          for(let i = 0; i < selectedResults.inputs.length; i++){
            //get input info
            let inputInfo = selectedResults.inputs[i]
            console.log("inputInfo: ",inputInfo)
            let input = {
              addressNList:bip32ToAddressNList(inputInfo.path),
              scriptType:core.BTCInputScriptType.SpendWitness,
              amount:String(inputInfo.value),
              vout:inputInfo.vout,
              txid:inputInfo.txId,
              segwit:false,
              hex:inputInfo.hex,
              tx:inputInfo.tx
            }
            inputs.push(input)
          }

    let {
      bip32ToAddressNList
    } = require('@pioneer-platform/pioneer-coins')

We use some helper libs and types provided by HDwallet and Pioneer

Now we need to calcute a change address

First we get xpub on account 1 for change

          //get xpub for change addresses
          let path =
            {
              symbol: 'DASH',
              address_n: [0x80000000 + 44, 0x80000000 + 5, 0x80000000 + 1],
              coin: 'Bitcoin',
              script_type: 'p2pkh',
              showDisplay: false
            }
    
          let responsePubkeyChange = await sdk.system.info.getPublicKey(path)
          console.log("responsePubkeyChange: ", responsePubkeyChange)
          console.log("responsePubkeyChange: ", responsePubkeyChange.xpub)

And then we ask pioneer for the next avaible change index

          //get change address
          let changeAddyIndex = await pioneer.GetChangeAddress({network:'DASH',xpub:responsePubkeyChange.xpub})
          changeAddyIndex = changeAddyIndex.data.changeIndex
          changeAddyIndex = changeAddyIndex + 1
          console.log("changeAddyIndex: ",changeAddyIndex)

and finally we generate the change address via the keepkey-sdk

          let addressInfo = {
            addressNList: [0x80000000 + 44, 0x80000000 + 5, 0x80000000 + 1, 0x80000000 + changeAddyIndex],
            coin: 'Dash',
            scriptType: 'p2pkh',
            showDisplay: false
          }
    
          let address = await sdk.address.uTXOGetAddress({
            address_n: addressInfo.addressNList,
            script_type:addressInfo.scriptType,
            coin:addressInfo.coin
          })
          console.log("address: ",address)

Now that we have the change address we put the final outputs together

          const outputsFinal = []
          console.log("selectedResults.outputs: ",selectedResults.outputs)
          console.log("outputsFinal: ",outputsFinal)
          for(let i = 0; i < selectedResults.outputs.length; i++){
            let outputInfo = selectedResults.outputs[i]
            console.log("outputInfo: ",outputInfo)
            if(outputInfo.address){
              //not change
              let output = {
                address:toAddress,
                addressType:"spend",
                scriptType:core.BTCInputScriptType.SpendWitness,
                amount:String(outputInfo.value),
                isChange: false,
              }
              if(output.address)outputsFinal.push(output)
            } else {
              //change
              let output = {
                address:changeAddress,
                addressType:"spend",
                scriptType:core.BTCInputScriptType.SpendWitness,
                amount:String(outputInfo.value),
                isChange: true,
              }
              if(output.address)outputsFinal.push(output)
            }
            console.log(i,"outputsFinal: ",outputsFinal)
          }

and then we sign

          let hdwalletTxDescription = {
            coin: 'Dash',
            inputs:inputsSelected,
            outputs:outputsFinal,
            version: 1,
            locktime: 0,
          }
    
          //signTx
          let signedTxTransfer = await sdk.bitcoin.btcSignTransaction(hdwalletTxDescription)
          signedTxTransfer = JSON.parse(signedTxTransfer)
          setSignedTx(signedTxTransfer.serializedTx)

Now we need to build the UI for broadcast

              <ModalFooter>
                {!signedTx ? <div>
                  <Button colorScheme='green' mr={3} onClick={onSend}>
                    Send
                  </Button>
                </div> : <div></div>}
                {!txid ? <div>
                  {signedTx ? <div>
                    <Button colorScheme='green' mr={3} onClick={onBroadcast}>
                      broadcast
                    </Button>
                  </div> : <div></div>}
                </div> : <div></div>}
                <Button colorScheme='blue' mr={3} onClick={onClose}>
                  exit
                </Button>
              </ModalFooter>

logic, if there is an error display an error

logic, if there is not a signedTx show the sign button

If there is a txid, don’t show the broadcast button

Stages of a transaction

unsigned -> Signed -> broadcasted -> confirmed

We use Pioneer api for broadcasting

          //broadcast TX
          let broadcastBodyTransfer = {
            network:"DASH",
            serialized:signedTx,
            txid:"unknown",
            invocationId:"unknown"
          }
          let resultBroadcastTransfer = await pioneer.Broadcast(null,broadcastBodyTransfer)
          resultBroadcastTransfer = resultBroadcastTransfer.data
          console.log("resultBroadcastTransfer: ",resultBroadcastTransfer)
          if(resultBroadcastTransfer.error){
            setError(resultBroadcastTransfer.error)
          }
          if(resultBroadcastTransfer.txid){
            setTxid(resultBroadcastTransfer.txid)
          }

now we display the txid for the user

with a link to a block explorer

                {txid ? <div>txid: <a href={'https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/tx.dws?'+txid+'.htm'}/> {txid}</div> : <div></div>}

## We now have a Complete Dapp!

Now lets deploy the app to production with Vercel

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0mg3tmvgcNWbx1cYm2UtZA.png)

Signup on Vercel

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*yRhb4Jycki4LqUkVzOqglQ.png)

After linking your github account with vercel we can deploy the project

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2840/1*80iya0M3wi6e6mNoQNzlEA.png)

Vercel will detect the build format of the app as we used create-react-add, and all the nessiciary configurations come out of the box

After success deployment you can collect the URL for your

    https://dash-dapp.vercel.app/

After we got a URL for our dapp lets go to pioneer and submit

Launch Pioneers Dapp from the dapp store

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*GDXMrh1Knci9rsD7rajowA.png)

And we navigate to “Explore Dapps.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KWub4j-BcIwf84OQ8KRi7Q.png)

Now we connect to the Dapp via Wallet-Connect

And we submit the Dapp to the Dapp Store

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2306/1*QIagIutiFoYLFvKSwJsZxQ.png)

I used a link I found of coincap.io for the app icon.
>  [*https://coincap.io/assets/dash](https://coincap.io/assets/dash)*

Next we Sign the Submission to register our KeepKeys address as the Developer/owner
