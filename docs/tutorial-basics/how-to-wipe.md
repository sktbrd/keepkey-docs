## Handling Forgotten PINs

If you've forgotten your PIN, don't fret! You can always recover your Keepkey by following these steps:

1. Wipe your Keepkey device by selecting the "Forgot your PIN" option during startup.

2. After wiping your device, proceed with the device recovery process.

   - If the device recovery feature is not working in KeepKey Desktop, you can use our legacy updater app.

     [KeepKey Updater](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-updater)

     The KeepKey Updater app provides a similar message for forgotten PINs during startup.

By wiping your device and going through the recovery process, you will be able to set a new PIN and regain access to your KeepKey.

Remember to keep your recovery seed in a secure place to ensure that you can always recover your KeepKey device if necessary.

:::warning Note
It's important to exercise caution and follow the official instructions provided by KeepKey to ensure the security and proper functioning of your device.
