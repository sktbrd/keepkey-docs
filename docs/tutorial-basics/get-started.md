8. **(Optional) Restore your Wallet using a Mnemonic recovery phrase**
    - You will be prompted to use a cipher to enter text via your keyboard.
    - Never enter your mnemonic recovery phrase in an application without using a cipher.
    - Any application asking to enter a mnemonic recovery phrase without a cipher is a scam!
