## The Desktop Application - User Guide ##

KeepKey has developed it's own software application and not longer uses Chrome Browser Plugins, or Shapeshift.com to operate.
Remember, you can download the Desktop Application here: https://keepkey.com/get-started

Let’s take  a moment to breakdown the compenets and what we are looking at with the new Desktop Application.

**1. Wallet Connect (Top Right Corner)**

**WalletConnect** is a technology that helps you securely link a decentralized application (dApp) with your KeepKey wallet. It makes it easier and safer for you to use dApps with your crypto assets.
Here's how it works:
**1.	dApp Interaction:** When you use a DApp on your computer, you often need to talk to your KeepKey to do things like signing transactions or accessing your crypto money.

**2.	QR Code or Deep Link:** WalletConnect usually creates a QR code or a special link that you can scan or click on within the DApp.

**3.	Connect KeepKey:** By scanning the QR code or clicking the link, you create a secure link between your DApp and your KeepKey. This connection allows the DApp to ask your KeepKey to do certain things, like signing a transaction.

**4.	Authorization:** You often have to say "yes" or "no" within your KeepKey to allow these actions. Your KeepKey shows you what it's being asked to do so you can make sure it's okay.

**5.	Transaction Signing:** If you say "yes," your KeepKey will put a digital signature on the transaction with your secret key. This makes sure it's real and safe.

**6.	Getting It Done:** The signed transaction goes back to the DApp, which can then send it out to the crypto network. This finishes the job you asked for.

WalletConnect is important because it makes sure your private keys stay safe inside your KeepKey while you use different DApps. It also makes using DApps easier because it helps you connect them to your crypto assets without any trouble



**Let’s use an example of connecting to Uniswap, a popular dApp**


First we will navigate to the site: https://app.uniswap.org/swap

Next we will select what chain we want to be on, in this example we can see we are on Ethereum, and click “Connect”
