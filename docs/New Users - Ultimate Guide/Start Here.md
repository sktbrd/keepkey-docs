## If KeepKey is your first introduction to cryptocurrency or hardware wallets, check out:
## COMPLETE, Step by Step, KeepKey Setup Guide

First off, don’t worry, you’re in safe hands. I have dabbled in cryptocurrency on a surface level for many years now, but it was only when I joined KeepKey last year that I began to dig deeper. I have spent a lot of time working with and learning from clients whose first experience setting up a wallet was with their KeepKey. Sometimes these clients have had zero experience dealing with cryptocurrency at all. It is my hope that, with access to some of the best security developers in the industry, along with my own experience with new clients, I can create the most descriptive Getting Started guide to date. The following article will be a step by step guide through the setup process, as well as explain some of the key concepts in Hardware Wallets. If successful it will provide anyone with all the information they need to set up their KeepKey and understand why they did it. 


To get started, after you’ve purchased your KeepKey, plug in the device using the supplied cables to your Mac, Windows, or Linux computer. Next head on over to www.KeepKey.com/Get-Started. 
 

 On this page, watch the YouTube “Get Started Video” to watch with the process of setting up your device. 


Next we’ll take a look at your KeepKey device itself. On the bottom there is a micro USB Port to be used with the cable provided. One face of the device is a slick solid piece of metal, and the other side is a screen made from tamper resistant hardened plastic. Let’s look at the plastic side. This screen will display important information while you are setting up the device, as well as when you are buying, moving, or interacting with your crypto. This is just a normal screen not a touch screen but notice as well, there is a single button on top of the device. This button is used during the updating process as well as when confirming things like your passphrase or making transactions. Think of this button as your YES man.


Image Intro.


If you want to continue with what your screen is asking you to do, you press this button! Simple as that. If you do not with to continue with what your screen is asking, cancel the process on the computer. 


While your still on www.KeepKey.com/Get-Started, make sure to download the KeepKey Desktop Application (Client) by selecting the appropriate operating system:
 

Image 1


After downloading, install the Application. EZPZ.
If you are a Windows user, you may experience a big blue popup saying, “Windows doesn’t recognize this publisher.” This is a common occurrence for open source software that isn’t in the Microsoft store (PS, there isn’t any popular crypto software in the Microsoft store, they aren’t big on crypto generally). Be confident that, if you downloaded the software from the KeepKey.com link, you are good to click “more info” and then “Run Anyway.” This only occurs when we release a new update as the Microsoft store eventually gets around to adding it, they just tend to take their time doing so. Remmeber also that any application that connects to the internet may need to be granted permissions to pass through the windows firewall, if promted allow KeepKey Desktop this access, otherwise you don't have to worry about it. 


All users, once your application is installed, and your KeepKey is plugged in, its time for 3..2..1… LAUNCH your KeepKey Desktop Application.


You will be met by our brief tutorial. Select your preferred language and change or keep any settings you want (default is fine for all users, advanced users can fine tune their experience here). The next few pages describe some of our new features like how to set your pin, what the BIP39 protocol is, what a dApp is, and how to access them in our Desktop. The tutorial is meant to be just enough information to get you going, remember you can always consult our FAQ page or receive live support on our Support page via Discord. 


Ok schools out, tutorial is done. We are now in the process of updating your new device. Don’t fret, we prepped for this. With our KeepKey plugged in we should see a screen like this:
 

Image 2.


Find that button on the top of the KeepKey. Hold it down, continue holding it down and unplug/plug back in your device. This will put the device in firmware update mode. The instructions on your screen will briefly disappear while unplugged and returns once plugged back in.  
The next screen you see should look like this:
 

Image 3.


Click update!


You will be prompted to look at your KeepKey to “Verify Backup.” We haven’t setup a backup yet, so you can skip this for now. Hold down the button on top of the device until you see it say “Preparing for Upgrade”


Congrats, we have begun updating the bootloader! The KeepKey will now ask you to again “disconnect and reconnect.” So unplug your KeepKey and plug it back in. (No button needed).


The device will finish updating the Bootloader. Let it do its thing without messing with it until you see it say “Firmware Update Mode” and the screen on your computer is prompting you for another update, this time for your firmware:
 

Image 4. 


Click update! Again, looking at your device, it will ask you to “Verify Backup.” We still haven’t set that up yet, so we can skip this again by holding down the button on the top of the device. Don't worry, we'll explain wht that is shortly.


After completion, both the device and the Desktop Application will restart, and you will be met with this page on your computer:

We’ve come so far, let's take a breath. The tech stuff is out of the way and your device is ready to become your unique, secure, and accessible passport to the expansive Cryptosphere. 


You are about to create a wallet which is a digital tool, much like a virtual purse or wallet, used to store and manage cryptocurrencies. It holds private keys, which are secret codes required to access and control your digital assets. Your KeepKey device stores these keys allowing only you to access them. This is the security advantage over keeping your crypto online. No matter what happens, as long as you have your wallet, you will never lose access to your crypto.
Here is a short and sweet description of wallets from Coinbase.com: https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-crypto-wallet
And here is a deeper dive on Crypto.com: https://crypto.com/university/crypto-wallets


Lets get rolling. Select “Create a New Wallet”
Next you can give your KeepKey a name. Feel free to get all sorts of creative in here or keep it simple; whatever works for you! Pick one out and click next or press Skip.

Next up is the first line of security that you will establish for your KeepKey, the Pin. Setting the pin can certainly be confusing at first. Refer to the video on www.KeepKey.com/Get-Started for a detailed visual explanation, but I will describe it here too. On your screen, you see a 9 digit number pad that has dots instead of numbers:


Image 7


Simultaneously, on your KeepKey Device you will see two number pads, one dark, and one light.
The numbers and their locations on the Device correspond to the dot and location on the screen. 
There are dark and light versions because this adds a level of complexity when bad actors are attempting to hack into a KeepKey. Notice the numbers are in the same locations, the only difference is the light and dark. 
 

Image 8


So we have these numbers in specific locations, like on a keyboard number pad but jumbled up. We are going to use this to choose a pin, like the one you use for a debit card, that we will enter every time we use the KeepKey. Select a number, preferably between four and nine digits. For each number, look at the device, note the location of the number, for example number 2 is in the top left corner in the image above. To set the number, in this case 2, use your mouse to select the upper left corner on the Application’s dot pad. Continue this process for each number in your pin. Once you have entered your pin, select “Continue.” You will be prompted to re-enter your pin, the same pin, for confirmation. 


WAIT. Did the numbers on the device just move? Yes, every time you go to enter your pin, the numbers on the pad will be in different locations. It’s a little confusing at first, but this is another effective way to stop bad actors from using your device. 

![Pin](https://github.com/BitHighlander/keepkey-docs/assets/47842709/8142e144-54b7-41f2-885e-76c88d597f00)


So we know the numbers moved, and we remember the numbers we selected for our pin. Now we will find where the first number of our pin is on the device. In my demonstration we see that 2, previously up in the top left corner, has moved over one space to the right as pictured below:
 

Image 9


We find the corresponding location on the dot pad on the Desktop application and press the dot. The thing to remember, the pin is the number sequence, not the location sequence. The dots we press each time will not be the same, but the numbers the dots represent in their locations are.

This takes some getting used to, again we strongly recommend watching thin in action on the video on: www.KeepKey.com/Get-Started 
It is no doubt a unique system, but I can assure you, it gets to be second nature after a few uses.


So now we’ve entered our pin a second time, lets click save pin and move on. 
We see that the KeepKey device is now telling us about the “Recovery Seed Backup”


![10 backup](https://github.com/BitHighlander/keepkey-docs/assets/47842709/b539c309-cb13-4ae0-89c9-205445dd5f86)



Inside of the box your KeepKey was shipped in is a green card, the size of a business card that is labelled ‘Recovery Sentence.”
 

Image 11


A Recovery Sentence, or Recovery Seed Backup, comprises 12 random words and is a crucial security feature for a cryptocurrency wallet. It serves as a safeguard for your wallet's private keys, enabling you to restore your wallet in case of loss or damage to your device. 
Here's a great explanation from Coinbase.com: https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-seed-phrase
And another from Brave.com: https://brave.com/web3/wallet-recovery-phrase/


YOU MUST WRITE DOWN THIS PHRASE NOW, IT WILL NOT BE SHOWN AGAIN.


Grab your card and a writing utensil and hold down the button on the device to have it generate your unique seed.


On your device, you will see a series of four words in order from 1-5. Again, you will see them duplicated in both dark and light, for the same reason as before. 
  

Image 12


Once you have written down your words in order on your card, hold down the button on the device to move to page 2/3.
 

Image 13


Now we see words 6-9. Write these down as well and then hold down the button for the next page.
  

Image 14


Here we are at 3/3 with our final 10-12 words.


Once we have written down all of our words we can continue to the next step, but first let’s take a pause and talk about what we should do with our new Recovery Sentence card. 


This card is the only means of recovering our wallet and crypto if anything happens to our device, and, if someone else gets this card or the information on it, they can take our wallets from us. We should keep this card in a secure location, the kind of place we store our Birth Certificates, important documents, cash, or precious metals. We don’t need to use this card often, but we need to be confident that we know where it is, and that it is secured from prying eyes or damage from fire or flooding. 


Next, we hold down the button again to complete the Recovery Sentence sequence and the entire update process. Our device and Desktop Application will now restart and open up to the default dApp.


We made it folks, your KeepKey is now, oficially, set up! You have your pin, made sure it is something you will remmeber, and we have our recovery sentance, stored away securely. Along with an updated device you are now ready to use the KeepKey and the Desktop Application.
